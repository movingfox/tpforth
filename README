TP-FORTH is just an experiment

It can tell you whether of not a number is a Prime:

VARIABLE NUM
: isPrime
	NUM SWAP ! 
	NUM @ 1 - 2 DO 
	NUM @ I MOD 0 = IF 0 EXIT THEN
	LOOP
	1
	;
 
However, it's full of bugs, and not usable as a Forth yet.
I've only put it up here for people to examine the design
That said, it's now a decent HP-like calculator
